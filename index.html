<h1>Homework 8</h1>
<h2>Stacey Liu</h2>
<h2>Topic</h2>
<h3>For this assignment, I decided to focus on the overlap between Florida's mangroves and the state's water quality testing locations. Th question of interest to me in this assignment is "how many of Florida's groundwater testing sites are located in mangrove habitat?" I used the buffer tool to place a 10 km buffer around each of Florida's groundwater testing stations to represent each individual "watershed" then used the intersect tool to see the overlap between the groundwater testing site buffers and the mangrove habitat.</h3>
